Copilot Instructions — “Relay Heat Sheet” Generator
Goal

Implement a Google Apps Script that:

Reads a Lane Assignments sheet (use the provided CSV as the layout example).

Pulls entries from five Team tabs (CENT, MVHS, MER, EAGLE, TIMBER).

Builds a Relay Meet Heat Sheet (by event → by heat → lanes 1–5) and generates a nicely formatted Google Doc on demand via a custom menu.

Use the attached example heat sheet content to match semantics while improving formatting
